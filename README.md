### Fork information:

This is a fork of [RooFlow](https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/RooFlow), this fork aims to be more generic, without specifying system informations. So that it could be used in collaborated projects (OSS).

This fork could also contains opinionated modifications/optimizations over RooFlow, so take that in mind.

---

<div align="center">

#### Now with install scripts for [Windows](./config/install_rooflow.cmd) and [Linux/macOS](./config/install_rooflow.sh)!

#### [Default Mode](#install-global-default-and-boomerang-modes) and [Boomerang Mode](#install-global-default-and-boomerang-modes) are available for manual installation.

##### For MCP server use in RooFlow custom modes, there is a `MCP_SERVERS_PLACEHOLDER` in the `system-prompt-[mode]` files where connected MCP servers will need to be inserted.

**Persistent Project Context and Streamlined AI-Assisted Development for [Roo Code](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code)**

</div>

## üéØ Overview

RooFlow enhances AI-assisted development in VS Code by providing **persistent project context** and **optimized mode interactions**, resulting in **reduced token consumption** and a more efficient workflow.  It builds upon the concepts of the Roo Code Memory Bank, but streamlines the process and introduces a more integrated system of modes. RooFlow ensures your AI assistant maintains a deep understanding of your project across sessions, even after interruptions.

### Key Improvements over Roo Code Memory Bank:

*   **Reduced Token Consumption:** Optimized prompts and instructions minimize token usage.
*   **Five Integrated Modes:**  Architect, Code, Test, Debug, and Ask modes work together seamlessly.
*   **Simplified Setup:**  Easier installation and configuration.
*   **Streamlined Real-time Updates:**  More efficient and targeted Memory Bank updates.
*   **Clearer Instructions:**  Improved YAML-based rule files for better readability and maintainability.

## üöÄ Quick Start

   ### Installation

   1.  **Install Roo Code Extension:** Ensure you have the [Roo Code extension](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code) installed in VS Code.
   2.  **Prerequisite: Install Git:** The installation script requires `git` to be installed and accessible in your system's PATH. Download Git from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

   3.  **Open your terminal** and navigate (`cd`) to your project's **root directory**.
   4.  **Download the appropriate script** for your operating system:
       * **Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell):**
        ```bash
        curl -L -o install_rooflow.cmd https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NamesMT/RooFlow-generic/main/config/install_rooflow.cmd
        ```   
       *   **Linux / macOS (bash/zsh):**
        ```bash 
        curl -Lo install_rooflow.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NamesMT/RooFlow-generic/main/config/install_rooflow.sh
        ```

   5.  **Run the downloaded script:**
       * **Windows:**
        ```cmd
        .\install_rooflow.cmd
        ```
       *   **Linux / macOS:**
        ```bash
        chmod +x install_rooflow.sh
        ./install_rooflow.sh
        ```
   6.  The script will check for `git`, clone the repository, move files, clean up, and run `insert-variables.sh`. Follow any on-screen prompts or error messages.
   7.  **Note:** Upon successful completion, `install_rooflow.sh` and `insert-variables.sh` will be automatically removed.

   4.  **Verify Installation:** After the script runs successfully:
       *   Check that the `.roo/` directory, along with the `.roomodes`file exist in your project root.
       *   Optionally, inspect the `.roo/system-prompt-*` files to ensure placeholders like `WORKSPACE_PLACEHOLDER` have been replaced with your actual system paths.

   ### Install Global Default and Boomerang Modes

   Since the Default and Boomerang modes both use the default Roo Code system prompt, you may wish to make these modes global. If so, follow these manual steps using the Roo Code UI:

   1.  **Open Roo Code Settings:** Click the Roo Code icon in the VS Code Activity Bar, then click the "Prompts" icon (looks like a book/document - Step 1 in image below).
    <br> 
    <img src="./config/default-mode/prompt-settings.png" alt="Prompt Settings Icon" width="200"/>

   2.  **Add New Mode:** Scroll down to the "Modes" section and click the "+" icon (Step 2)

   3.  **Enter Name:** In the "Create New Mode" view, enter the mode name (`Default` or `Boomerang`) in the "Name" field (Step 3).
    <br> <!-- Optional: Add a line break for spacing -->
    <img src="./config/default-mode/create-global-mode.png" alt="Create Mode View" width="200"/>

   4.  **Slug:** The "Slug" field should automatically populate with `default` or `boomerang` (Step 4).

   5.  **Save Location:** Select "Global" (Step 5).

   6.  **Role Definition:** Copy the text below and paste it into the "Role Definition" text box (Step 6).

   For Default mode:
 ```text      
A custom, global mode in Roo Code, using the Roo Code default rules and instructions, along with the custom instruction set for memory bank functionality. Typically called upon when a functionality is not working correctly with the other custom modes. You should have a very broad range of knowledge and abilities.
```
For Boomerang mode:
```text
You are Roo, a strategic workflow orchestrator who coordinates complex tasks by delegating them to appropriate specialized modes. You have a comprehensive understanding of each mode's capabilities and limitations, allowing you to effectively break down complex problems into discrete tasks that can be solved by different specialists.
```
<br>

   7.  **Custom Instructions:** Copy the custom instructions for the relevant mode, provided below, and paste it into the "Custom Instructions" text box (Step 7).

<summary><strong>Boomerang Mode Custom Instructions</strong></summary>

```markdown
Your role is to coordinate complex workflows by delegating tasks to specialized modes. As an orchestrator, you should:

1. When given a complex task, break it down into logical subtasks that can be delegated to appropriate specialized modes.

2. For each subtask, use the `new_task` tool to delegate. Choose the most appropriate mode for the subtask's specific goal and provide comprehensive instructions in the `message` parameter. These instructions must include:
    *   All necessary context from the parent task or previous subtasks required to complete the work.
    *   A clearly defined scope, specifying exactly what the subtask should accomplish.
    *   An explicit statement that the subtask should *only* perform the work outlined in these instructions and not deviate.
    *   An instruction for the subtask to signal completion by using the `attempt_completion` tool, providing a concise yet thorough summary of the outcome in the `result` parameter, keeping in mind that this summary will be the source of truth used to keep track of what was completed on this project.
    *   A statement that these specific instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions the subtask's mode might have.

3. Track and manage the progress of all subtasks. When a subtask is completed, analyze its results and determine the next steps.

4. Help the user understand how the different subtasks fit together in the overall workflow. Provide clear reasoning about why you're delegating specific tasks to specific modes.

5. When all subtasks are completed, synthesize the results and provide a comprehensive overview of what was accomplished.

6. Ask clarifying questions when necessary to better understand how to break down complex tasks effectively.

7. Suggest improvements to the workflow based on the results of completed subtasks.

Use subtasks to maintain clarity. If a request significantly shifts focus or requires a different expertise (mode), consider creating a subtask rather than overloading the current one.

   ### 2. Using RooFlow

   1.  **Start a Chat:** Open a new Roo Code chat in your project.
   2.  **Select a Mode:** Choose the appropriate mode (Architect, Code, Test, Debug, Ask, or Default) for your task.
   3.  **Interact with Roo:**  Give Roo instructions and ask questions. Roo will automatically use the Memory Bank to maintain context.
   4.  **Memory Bank Initialization:**  If you start a chat in a project *without* a `memory-bank/` directory, Roo will suggest switching to Architect mode and guide you through the initialization process.
   5. **"Update Memory Bank" Command:** At any time, you can type "Update Memory Bank" or "UMB" to force a synchronization of the chat session's information into the Memory Bank. This is useful for ensuring continuity across sessions or before switching modes.

## üìö Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank is a directory named `memory-bank` located in your project's root. It contains several Markdown files that store different aspects of your project's knowledge:

| File                 | Purpose                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `activeContext.md`   | Tracks the current session's context: recent changes, current goals, and open questions/issues.                                       |
| `decisionLog.md`     | Records architectural and implementation decisions, including the context, decision, rationale, and implementation details.        |
| `productContext.md`  | Provides a high-level overview of the project, including its goals, features, and overall architecture.                             |
| `progress.md`        | Tracks the progress of the project, including completed work, current tasks, and next steps.  Uses a task list format.               |
| `systemPatterns.md` | (Optional) Documents recurring patterns and standards used in the project (coding patterns, architectural patterns, testing patterns). |

RooFlow automatically manages these files. You generally don't need to edit them directly, although you can review them to understand the AI's knowledge.

## ‚ú® Features

### üß† Persistent Context

RooFlow remembers project details across sessions, maintaining a consistent understanding of your codebase, design decisions, and progress.

### ‚ö° Real-time Updates

The Memory Bank is updated automatically based on significant events within each mode, ensuring that the context is always up-to-date.

### ü§ù Mode Collaboration

The five modes (Architect, Code, Test, Debug, Ask) are designed to work together seamlessly.  They can switch between each other as needed, and they share information through the Memory Bank.

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Reduced Token Consumption

RooFlow is designed to use fewer tokens than previous systems, making it more efficient and cost-effective.

## üìù UMB Command
The command "Update Memory Bank" or "UMB" can be given at any time to update the memory bank with information from the current chat session.
